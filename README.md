# HabitsApp

#### About this project
"Men's natures are alike, it is their habits that carry them far apart" ~ Confucius

Habits are powerful driving forces in peoples' lives. Just as much as a good habit can propel a person, so too can a bad habit destroy one. In an effort to inculcate better habits in my life, I came up with this habit tracking app. While there are many apps out there, I wanted a no-frills version: one that displays everything I need at a glance, with a very straightforward user-interface which would encourage consistent use of the app.
